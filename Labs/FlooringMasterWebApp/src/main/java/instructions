Ask the user to enter in a width, 
length and the 
cost per 1 unit of flooring. 

Have the program calculate how much it would cost to cover the area specified with the flooring.  
sqFoot * material costperSqft = cost of Material

Also have the program calculate how much labor costs would be given that 
the average flooring team can only put in 20 square feet of flooring per hour 
at a cost of $86.00/hr with a 15 minute billing increment. 

matType, matCost, laborCost
Carpet,2.25,2.10
Laminate,1.75,2.10
Tile,3.50,4.15
Wood,5.15,4.75

need total square feet, 
calculate number hours of labor needed (totalsqFeet/20 == number of hours needed for job in QuarterHours NumHrs/4 w. no remainder)
calculate 86/4 = 21.50 per each quarterHr
