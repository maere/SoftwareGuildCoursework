	What is a variable?
A variable is used to store a value.

	What is a variable declaration?
A variable declaration is used to type a variable and declare that you will be using it in the program.

    What is a variable assignment?
A variable assignment is when you assign a value to the variable that has been declared.

    Can I declare and assign a variable on the same line?
Yes (e.g. int a = 2;)

    Can a method return more than one value?
No.

    What return type must be declared for methods that do not return a value?
Void.

    How are code blocks marked in Java?
{}

    What makes up a method's signature?
the method name and parameter list (e.g. myMethod(int a))

    What is a method parameter?
a method parameter is something that requires an argument be passed to it when the method is called. It is a value the particular method will need to function appropriately.

    How many parameters can a method have?
256, according to the space afforded on the machine, but in practice 3-7 is the upper limit of what is useful for most purposes.

    Do all of the parameters for a method have to be of the same type?
No.

    What does the import keyword do?
It makes the main() aware of the package from which you are pulling methods that are used in your program (e.g. Scanner, or PrintWriter)

    What is the naming convention for Java classes?
CapitalCamelCase

    What is the naming convention for Java variables?
lowerUpperCamelCase

    What is the naming convention for Java methods?
lowerUpperCamelCase

    What is a method body?
It is the part between the curly braces where the code executes.

    What is an array?
An array is a data structure that stores elements according to a numbered index.

    When is it better to use a for loop over a while loop?
When you know how many times you will need to iterate.

    What is the difference between a while loop and a do/while loop?
A do/while loop executes at least once.  A while loop may never execute if its condition evaluates to false.

    What is a switch statement?
A  switch statement allows you to test very specific cases and execute a code block according to the match. It also allows you to set a default.

    What is scope?
Scope is the extent to which a variable is recognized by the code.  Class level scope is global and can be understood in any part of the code nested within it.  A local scope (an integer declared within the for loop) will not be available after the code block is finished executing.
