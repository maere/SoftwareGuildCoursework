This is my work from the the Software Craftsmanship Guild (now called The Software Guild). The most interesting code to look at is in the Labs, since those were projects where we were given an assignment and had to build something from scratch.  

There are also several projects which got continually refactored, from console application to basic web app, to MVC app, to database CRUD web app. The quickest way to see those projects is to go to [Portfolio](http://github.com/maere/Portfolio.)

Happy to answer questions about any of these projects!
