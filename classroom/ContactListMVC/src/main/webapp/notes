Old way of doing things:

/displayContact?contactId=42 

REST doesnt' use the question marks, or passs params in the URL

REST equivalent:
/contact/42

For our project the urls will be like:
-------------------------


Display a Contact
Verb: GET
/contact/{contactId}

(our method is getContact in the controller)
------------------

Create a contact
Verb: POST
/contact

Request: JSON object containing the contact data
Response: JSON object containing the contact data

(we're doing this just to verify and display properly)

----------------------------------

Delete a Contact
Verb:DELETE
/contact/{contactId}
(so is same as url to display, but the verb is different this is DELETE, that was GET

---------------------------------

Update a Contact
Verb: PUT
/contact/${contactId}
Request: JSON object that contains the contact info
Response: nonee (tho might want a success msg)

------------------------

Get a List of all the Contacts
Verb: GET
/contacts       (don't need to say more than that bc that's what we want--all the contacts)
Request: nothing
Response: JSON array that contains all the info for every contact in the system
